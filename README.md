Like protocol buffers, but designed to support Yaml.

Define data using algebraic data types. Reuse the same data definition
to map to your values in Kotlin and Haskell programs. One schema, can
use same data in any place with any in memory representation and know
that it will work. 

Html documentation. clear for everyone. clients and developers.

Lulo can be defined using Lulo, and in fact, it is. Schemas are just 
documents, and Lulo parses them the same way that it parse any other document. 
This implies the existence of a **schema schema** which defines 
the format of all schemas.

The schema schema is hard-coded into the implementation because the 
schema schema is a schema, and we cannot parse a schema without the schema schema.

Since Lulo itself is a schema, it's HTML documentation can be
automatically generated -- it is self-documenting.
